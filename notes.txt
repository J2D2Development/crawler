ORGANIZE INTO VUE.JS
    1) do we want to use vue routing?  move the actual action to the 'action' tab and give it a shot.
        -might move to vue cli and have it be a spa?

UI UPDATES
    1) Integrate my regular js (for menu clicking, effects, etc) into Vue- see codepen
    2) onbeforeunload (or whaterver method is called) if process is running, warn user if they click away that process will cancel! - double check, will it?
    3) notice before crawl of filter applied and total routes that will be crawled.  add in homepage/sitemap/blogs (have option to exclude these)?

SET UP DATABASE
store crawl-log in db instead of files
    1) Get 'last run' (order by date desc)
    2) map db structure
    3) be sure to sanitize: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-mongo-sanitize (or better)?

EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS?
do we want this?  maybe just on fail?
