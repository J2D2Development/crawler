1) do we want to use vue routing?  move the actual action to the 'action' tab and give it a shot.
    -might move to vue cli and have it be a spa?
2) store last run somewhere?  set up simple mongodb?  or maybe practice with postgres
3) Integrate my regular js (for menu clicking, effects, etc) into Vue
4) onbeforeunload (or whaterver method is called) if process is running, warn user if they click away that process will cancel! - double check, will it?
5) notice before crawl of filter applied and total routes that will be crawled.  add in homepage/sitemap/blogs (have option to exclude these)?
